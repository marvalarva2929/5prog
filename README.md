To run the program, run ./build.sh.
This will create two files, hw5-asm and hw5-sim.

hw5-asm takes two arguments, an input file name for tinker code and an output file name for binary code.
hw5-sim takes one argument, the output binary file, which it will run.

Assembling and running the fibonacci.tk file, and passing in a number n to stdin will return the nth fibonacci number.
Assembling and running the binary_search.tk file and passing in a number n followed by n integers, as well as a value to search for will return if that value exists in the array or not using the binary search method.

Tests for this program are contained in test.c
